# Requirements

OpenMW 49 (version from which i created the mod)

OpenMW 48 (it may work but never tested)

# How to install

Create a folder containing the downloaded files.
Launch OpenMW launcher and add Data Files by selecting the created folder.
Check the box named showGoldAmount.omwscript.
Launch the game

# How to use

In game, go to the "Scripts" tab in the options.
You can choose the gold Name, the Text SIze, the positionning (x,y) and whether or not to display the gold amount.

You can choose to display the gold amount on the Inventory and the Text Size.
You can drag and drop the amount on your Interface :

- Click one time on the Gold Amount to enter Edition mode
- Move the cursor to the desired position
- Click again to leave edition mode and save the position

\*\*/!\ Don't move the cursor too fast not to lose focus. You can still bring it back to re-gain focus and be able to continue drag and drop /!\*\*

# Compatibility

To use it well with [Smart Interface Menu Opening (SIMO)](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/57140) mod, be sure to associate the Gold amount with the right interface "Map/Magic/Inventory/Stats"

If you don't use this mod, just let "All" in the settings.
